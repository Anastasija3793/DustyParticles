# DustyParticles
DustyParticles is a programming project for Principles and Practice of Programming.
This is the program which represents a particle system.
The particle system itself represents a 'cloud' of dust particles.
The 'cloud' floats diagonally when it is in its normal/default behaviour (state).
However, it changes when states are switched (such as 'explosion', 'freeze', 'galaxy')
by pressing certain keys.
It is also possible to pause/unpause timer and change particles colours also by keys.
After a certain time particles return to their normal/default state.
## Change colours:

- r - red; 
- g - green; 
- b - blue; 
- y - yellow; 
- o - white; 
- z - default; 
- ENTER (RETURN) - random colour

## Control keys:

- p - pause/resume; 
- f - freeze;
- SPACE - explosion; 
- TAB - 'dust galaxy'/sphere
- ESC - escape the program

## Camera control keys:

**UP arrow** - move up; 
**DOWN arrow** - move down; 
**RIGHT arrow** - move right; 
**LEFT arrow** - move left;

- 1 - 'zoom in'/move closer; 
2 - 'zoom out'/move farther; 
0 - return camera to the default position/look at

- w - look up; 
s - look down; 
d - look right; 
a - look left; 
q / e - changing z axis of where camera look at/turn
