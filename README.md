# DustyParticles
DustyParticles is a programming project for Principles and Practice of Programming.
This is the program which represents a particle system.
The particle system itself represents a 'cloud' of dust particles.
The 'cloud' floats diagonally when it is in its normal / default behaviour (state).
However, it changes when states are switched (such as 'explosion', 'freeze', 'galaxy')
by pressing certain keys.
It is also possible to pause / unpause timer and change particles colours also by keys.
After a certain time particles return to their normal / default state.
## Change colours:

- r - red; 
- g - green; 
- b - blue; 
- y - yellow; 
- o - white; 
- z - default; 
- ENTER (RETURN) - random colour

## Control keys:

- p - pause / resume; 
- f - freeze;
- SPACE - explosion; 
- TAB - 'dust galaxy' / sphere
- ESC - escape the program

## Camera control keys:

- UP arrow - move up; 
- DOWN arrow - move down; 
- RIGHT arrow - move right; 
- LEFT arrow - move left;
- 1 - 'zoom in' / move closer; 
- 2 - 'zoom out' / move farther; 
- 0 - return camera to the default position / look at
- w - look up; 
- s - look down; 
- d - look right; 
- a - look left; 
- q / e - changing z axis of where camera look at / turn

## Requirements
- Qt creator
- OpenGL
- SDL2
